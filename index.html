    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>That's everyone's first salutation to the coding world.</p>
    <p>Despite this not being three to five sentences, </p>
    <p>This line is considered a paragraph according to HTML</p>
    <p>Shouldn't be too hard, right?</p>
    <p>To write a poem in HTML.</p>
    <p>I mean all it takes is lines arranged</p>
    <p>In a way that flows somewhat nicely</p></p>
    <p>Now that I can code my first page</p>
    <p>I'd like to learn to make a dress up game</p>
    <p>Like the ones I used to play in my childhood<p>
    <p>Before flash died, however. Shame, really.<p>
    <p>Shouldn't be too hard, right?</p>
    <p>To make a character creator in HTML</p>
    <p>I mean all you need are the PNGs arranged</p>
    <p>In a way that flows somewhat nicely</p>
